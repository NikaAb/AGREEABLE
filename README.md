# BCR GTG

**Automatic generation of ground truth for the evaluation of clonal grouping methods in B-cell populations**

BCR Ground Truth Generator (BCR GTG)  is an automatic method to generate clonal grouping ground truth from real IGH repertoires annotated by IMGT/HighV-QUEST.

## Inputs
 
  * The IMGT/HighV-QUEST's output in one unzipped folder.
    The following files must be provided:
    * 1_Summary
    * 2_IMGT-gapped
  * See [example input files](https://github.com/NikaAb/BCR_GTG/tree/master/Database/IMGT_highvquest_output)

## Outputs

  * BCR GTG returns:

    - 5 tab delimited file:

      * [repertoire_name]\_unannotated_seq.txt : any sequences that could not be annotated fully. [example](https://github.com/NikaAb/BCR_GTG/blob/master/Database/GTM_output/I1_IMGT/I1_IMGT_unannotated_seq.txt)

      The columns are:
      ```
      seq Id   functionality  IGHV_and_allele IGHJ_and_allele CDR3
      ```
      * [repertoire_name]\_cluster_distribution.txt : clusters and their abundance sorted from highest to lowest.[example](https://github.com/NikaAb/BCR_GTG/blob/master/Database/GTM_output/I1_IMGT/I1_IMGT_cluster_distribution.txt)

      The columns are:
      ```
      cluster_Id   abundance
      ```

      * [repertoire_name]\_initial_clusters_Fo.txt : initial clustering output. Sequences with the same IGHV and IGHJ genes, same CDR3 sequence length, and CDR3 identity higher than 70% are grouped together.[example](https://github.com/NikaAb/BCR_GTG/blob/master/Database/GTM_output/I1_IMGT/I1_IMGT_initial_clusters_Fo.txt)

      Each line contains the one cluster id and all the sequence ids of it's members.
      ```
      cluster_Id   seqid1 seqid2 ...
      ```
      * [repertoire_name]\_final_clusters_Fo.txt : final clustering output, after minimizing intraclonal distances and maximizing interclonal distances.[example](https://github.com/NikaAb/BCR_GTG/blob/master/Database/GTM_output/I1_IMGT/I1_IMGT_final_clusters_Fo.txt)
      ```
      cluster_Id   seqid1 seqid2 ...
      ```
      * [repertoire_name]\_final_clusters_seq_info.txt : each line contains the following information for each sequence:
      ```
      Cluster_id__clonotype_id   seq Id  functionality  IGHV_and_allele IGHJ_and_allele CDR3 Junction
      ```
          [example](https://github.com/NikaAb/BCR_GTG/blob/master/Database/GTM_output/I1_IMGT/I1_IMGT_final_clusters_seq_info.txt)

    - A png file containing:

      ![alt text](https://github.com/NikaAb/BCR_GTG/blob/master/Database/GTM_output/I1_IMGT/I1_IMGT_repertoire.png "Title Text")

      A) Circle representation of the clone abundance.Each  circle  symbolizes  a  clone,and the cloneâ€™s abundance is shown through its size.

      B) Number of sequences in each clone, all clones are represented, vertical axe is in log scale.

      C) Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. A Lorenz curve shows the graphical represen-tation of clonal inequality. On the horizontal axe, it plots the cumulative fraction oftotal clones when ordered from the less to the most abundant; On the vertical axe,it show the cumulative fraction of sequences.

      D) Percentage of the 100 most abundant clones.
       



## Using BCR GTG 
  In the GTM/Src , run the following command:
  ```
  $ bash run_GTM.sh [repertoire_name]
  ```
                      
  Output files will be placed as such:
  ```
  ~GTM/Src/Output/[repertoire_name]/[repertoire_name]_cluster_distribution.txt
                                    [repertoire_name]_final_clusters_Fo.txt
                                    [repertoire_name]_final_clusters_seq_info.txt
                                    [repertoire_name]_initial_clusters_Fo.txt
                                    [repertoire_name]_unannotated_seq.txt
                                    [repertoire_name]_repertoire.png
 ```
 [repertoire_name] is the IMGT/highVquast's output folder name.
